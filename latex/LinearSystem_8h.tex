\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is the class for the management of a linear system. ~\newline
 

This class is endowed with different methods that let us copy, add or extract parts of the matrix, of the right hand side or of the solution vector. It also provides functions to get and set values, to save the matrix and algorithms that invert the matrix and solve the linear system.
