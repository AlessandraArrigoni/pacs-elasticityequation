\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is the base abstract class. It contains all the methods andattributes that both the “symmetric” and the “basic” approach need without specialization. 

This class contains the functions that extract the solution and compute or print errors in the L$^\wedge$2 and H$^\wedge$1 norm. The methods which deeply change according to the P\+D\+Es system and the algebraic formulation have been defined virtual. These are the ones for the construction of the matrix, of the right-\/hand-\/sideand the treatment of the boundary and interface conditions and the resolution of the linear system.
