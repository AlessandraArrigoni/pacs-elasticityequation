\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This class contains all the necessary features for a generic finite element method. 

This class is actually a wrapper of the already existing getfem\+::fem class in the library Getfem++. It incorporates only the instruments that were really needed, such as the problem\textquotesingle{}s dimension, the definition of the degrees of freedom and the selection f the functional space for the trial and test functions.
